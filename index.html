        <p>This is logo created by Clent Argero S. Toting which is inspired from computer programming.
            Orange fruit represents that it will help you to stay active when you are writing code, 
            because sometimes we feel lazy in programming. Initial CA stands for "Code Active" and it is 
            inside curly braces, curly braces is used because it is one of the most used text character in programming.

                <p>
        I am Clent Argero Soncados Toting. My course is Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
        Studied at Bukidnon State University in Malaybalay City. Born in October 01, 2000 at Barangay Mandahikan Cabanglasan Bukidnon. 
        I have my elementary in Manggaod Elementary School and highschool in Father Leoni Memorial School with General Academic Strand (GAS).
        Studying computer programming made me realise that I love software development, but before programming my habits are religious activities online games
        in fact I decided to take BSIT because I love computers in a way of gaming. Also my father encourages me and I don't have regret.
